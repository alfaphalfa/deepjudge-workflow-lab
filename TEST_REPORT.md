3. **Lighthouse audit** - Run Chrome Lighthouse for performance metrics

### Priority 2 (Nice to Have)
1. **Add loading states** - Skeleton screens for data-heavy components
2. **Error boundaries** - Add error handling for component failures
3. **Accessibility** - Add ARIA labels for screen readers
4. **Meta tags** - Add proper SEO meta tags for each page

### Priority 3 (Future Enhancement)
1. **Real data integration** - Connect to actual backend APIs
2. **User authentication** - Add login/logout functionality
3. **Analytics tracking** - Add event tracking for user interactions
4. **Progressive Web App** - Add PWA capabilities
